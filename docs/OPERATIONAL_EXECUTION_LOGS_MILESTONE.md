### Interpretation by flow
- simple-llm-test-flow
  - **LLM ran end-to-end successfully** with dynamic inputs, outbound request, and response handling.
  - Nodes `start` and `end` ran; the flow reached a terminal success state.

- llm-tool-calling-flow
  - **LLM tool use succeeded**: the LLM output was analyzed and an external HTTP tool (`http_search`) executed successfully.
  - Flow finished successfully.

- splitnode-map-reduce-flow
  - **Parallel fan-out executed**: `split_mapper` launched three mapper branches that completed.
  - A reducer aggregated results; `output` ran; flow completed successfully.

- simple-splitnode-flow
  - **Parallel split executed**: `split_test` started; `task1` and `task2` ran (order reflects concurrency).
  - `output` ran; split completed successfully.

- test-flow
  - Minimal flow where `start` ran and the execution completed successfully.

### In production effect
- **All executions completed successfully** with no errors or retries.
- **External side effects** occurred where configured:
  - LLM nodes made real outbound API calls and produced responses for downstream nodes.
  - Tool-calling flows performed network I/O (`http_search`) successfully.
- **Concurrency behaved as designed**: splits fanned out in parallel and rejoined deterministically.
- **Operational signal**: Orchestrator loaded configs, injected inputs, executed nodes, and persisted structured logs; the system is healthy under these scenarios.
